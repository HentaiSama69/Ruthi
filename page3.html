              I just wanted to take a moment to put into words what you mean to me, even though I know words will never
              truly do it justice.<br /><br />I wanna thank you for being the most amazing part of my life. Every single
              day with you feels brighter and fuller. You have this incredible ability to make me laugh and stress me
              out at the same time, life would be so boring without you stressing me out everyday. Thank you for being
              my favorite source of happiness and mild anxiety. You know exactly how to make my heart race whether it’s
              from love, laughter, or sheer panic.You make life so much more fun, exciting, and unpredictable and I
              wouldn’t have it any other way. I love you more than words can say, even if I sometimes jokingly give you
              my bombastic side eyes at your shenanigans. You’re my best friend, my partner in crime, and the person I’d
              gladly let drive me crazy for the rest of my life. Thank you for being my chaos, my comfort, and my
              partner in all the weirdness life throws at us.. I love you Ruthi and Thank you for being you and for
              loving me the way you do. Ka duh lutk che den heavy over. muah muah muah ( I losted it here, please
              ignore)<br /><br />Sincerley,<br />Your Autistic Boyfriend
